# SmartEditTrack: Undetectable Student Modification Logger in Excel using Python
---

## Project Overview

This repository contains a project developed under the theme of **Data Analytics**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Educational Software Automation**. The objective is to ensure **academic integrity** by **transparently logging** user interactions with Excel files—especially in contexts like **student assignments**, **lab sheets**, or **in-class assessments**—without disrupting the user experience.
The tool is built in **Python** and leverages libraries such as `openpyxl`, `pandas`, and `win32com.client` to monitor and record detailed **file modification metadata**, including cell-level edits, timestamps, user actions, and file session history.

**Project ID:** R&D Cyber N°1

## Project Goals

This project is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

- **Track Excel Modifications Transparently**  
  Record cell changes, sheet edits, and structural modifications made within Excel files during academic exercises or evaluations.

- **Enable Undetectable Logging Mechanisms**  
  Design the logger to operate silently in the background, storing logs in hidden or encrypted formats to ensure stealth and integrity.

- **Support Academic Assessment Integrity**  
  Provide teachers and researchers with a **forensic tool** to analyze student interactions during digital assessments.

- **Ensure Ethical Use and Privacy Awareness**  
  Build the system under ethical guidelines for handling student data, with a focus on **data privacy**, **consent**, and **educational enhancement** rather than punitive use.

## Technologies and Tools Used

The following tools and libraries have been used for development and deployment:

- **Python:** Main programming language for logic and automation.
- **openpyxl:** For reading and writing Excel files (.xlsx).
- **pandas:** For data processing and comparison of file states.
- **win32com.client:** Enables deeper interaction with Excel sessions and user behavior tracking.
- **cryptography:** (Optional) For encrypting log files before saving or sending.
- **smtplib or Webhooks:** (Optional) To send logs to a remote location (e.g., supervisor email, dashboard).
- **Tkinter or CLI interface:** For optional user interface interaction (if needed).
- **Git:** For version control and project management.

## Key Features

### 1. **Stealth Excel Logger**
   - Runs invisibly in the background once the student opens or edits a specified Excel file.
   - Detects and logs:
     - Cell value changes (e.g., before vs after).
     - Sheet renaming, addition, or deletion.
     - Structural edits (e.g., column insertion/deletion).
     - File opening/closing times.
     - User and session metadata (system name, OS, etc.).

### 2. **Secure Logging and Export***
   - Logs are:
     - Stored in hidden files on the system or Excel metadata itself.
     - Optionally encrypted for added security.
     - Auto-exported to a remote server or instructor dashboard

### 3. **Educational Use Case Oriented**
   - Designed for academic scenarios where Excel-based deliverables are used:
     - Engineering calculations
     - Data analysis labs
     - Digital forms or reports
   - Enables instructors to validate effort, trace unusual patterns, and detect anomalies or potential cheating.

### 4. **Documentation and Research-Readiness**
   - All components are documented with clear **installation instructions**, **code usage**, and **ethical guidelines**.
   - Optional inclusion of a **scientific report**, **poster**, or **research article** discussing:
     - Methodology
     - System architecture
     - Educational context
     - Ethical implications
